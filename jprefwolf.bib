  abstract = {Robot security is becoming more and more a serious issue for many modern applications. Robot security matters are still not intensively addressed in the published literature. The goal of this paper is to explore possible identification and security mechanisms which fit to robot technologies and their operating environment. To secure transactions between robots deployed in open service, robots need first to be securely identified Â¿as {personsÂ}¿ with unique provable identities. Robots rolling from a production line are assumed to be equal objects; therefore the first necessary action is to personalize robots and give them unclonable identities. A sort of Â¿electronic {mutationÂ}¿ technology was specified and proposed to create a non-reversible and non-repeatable robot identity, which is at the same time securely provable [6]. The identity exhibits properties similar to those of human {DNA}. The resulting clone-resistant or (unclonable) identity is adapted and proposed to be embedded in a robot environment. The goal is also to diffuse the identity traces possibly into all robot activities similarly as the human {DNA} do throughout the whole body of a biological creature. The identity proposed is made traceable through cryptographic signatures linked to relevant robot mechanical and electronic activities as a step towards Â¿mechatronic {securityÂ}¿. The work is also aiming to stimulate discussions on robot security issues or in general the question of Â¿mechatronic {securityÂ}¿.},

  abstract = {In vehicular networks, broadcast communications are critically important, as many safety-related applications rely on single-hop beacon messages broadcast to neighbor vehicles. However, it becomes a challenging problem to design a broadcast authentication scheme for secure vehicle-to-vehicle communications. Especially when a large number of beacons arrive in a short time, vehicles are vulnerable to computation-based Denial of Service ({DoS}) attacks that excessive signature verification exhausts their computational resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient broadcast authentication scheme called Prediction-Based Authentication ({PBA}) to not only defend against computation-based {DoS} attacks, but also resist packet losses caused by high mobility of vehicles. In contrast to most existing authentication schemes, our {PBA} is an efficient and lightweight scheme since it is primarily built on symmetric cryptography. To further reduce the verification delay for some emergency applications, {PBA} is designed to exploit the sender vehicle's ability to predict future beacons in advance. In addition, to prevent memory-based {DoS} attacks, {PBA} only stores shortened re-keyed Message Authentication Codes ({MACs}) of signatures without decreasing security. We analyze the security of our scheme and simulate {PBA} under varying vehicular network scenarios. The results demonstrate that {PBA} fast verifies almost 99 percent messages with low storage cost not only in high-density traffic environments but also in lossy wireless environments.},

This scheme is very efficient since it employs only hash function and {XOR} operation. However, we found that Turkanovic et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack with node capture, stolen smart card attack, sensor node spoofing attack, stolen verifier attack, and fails to ensure backward secrecy. We propose an efficient scheme to overcome all those weaknesses. Moreover, we also propose an advanced scheme, which provides perfect forward secrecy without much modification from the first proposed scheme.},

A series of examples will be examined in order to attempt to identify the ethical problems that we confront recreational, civilian/commercial and military uses of drones. In order to carry out the ethical analysis I will first survey how drone aircraft create ethical problems and how humans play an important role in how ethical issues emerge for drones. After the identification of the ethical issues with the types of drones we can next move on to how drone aircraft may function in the future and what ethical issues may arise for the future development and deployment of autonomous drones.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICARA.2015.7081183},
  abstract = {Fires cause billions of dollars in damage and thousands of deaths each year. Firefighting robots are being deployed around the world to reduce the loss of human life and the amount of property damage. High-rise buildings are used for both business and family homes. Buildings with dozens of floors present a great challenge to firefighters. Firefighter ladders cannot reach high enough to fight fires at the top of the building. Going into the building itself, in order to extinguish the blazing fire, is typically too dangerous and puts firefighters at risk. Monitoring, locating, and extinguishing the fire in the smallest amount of time is crucial to controlling fires in highrise buildings. This paper introduces humanoid robots capable of moving towards and extinguishing a fire and locating and rescuing any humans unlucky enough to be trapped in the inferno. This paper is one part of a Cooperative Fire Security System using {HARMS} ({CFS}2H) that detects, locates, and extinguishes a fire and rescues human beings using the Human, Agent, Robot, Machine, Sensor ({HARMS}) protocol.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in applying machine learning to motion planning. Potential applications are predicting an initial seed for trajectory optimization, predicting an effective heuristic for search based planning, and even predicting a planning algorithm for adaptive motion planning systems. In these situations, providing only a single prediction is unsatisfactory. It leads to many scenarios where the prediction suffers a high loss. In this paper, we advocate list prediction. Each predictor in a list focusses on different regions in the space of environments. This overcomes the shortcoming of a single predictor, and improves overall performance. A framework for list prediction, {ConseqOpt}, already exists. Our contribution is an extensive domain-specific treatment. We provide a rigorous and clear exposition of the procedure for training a list of predictors. We provide experimental results on a spectrum of motion planning applications. Each application contributes to understanding the behavior of list prediction. We observe that the benefit of list prediction over a single prediction is significant, irrespective of the application.},
