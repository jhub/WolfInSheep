  abstract    = {The robot localization problem is a key problem in making truly autonomous
robots. If a robot does not know where it is, it can be difficult to determine
what to do next. In order to localize itself, a robot has access to relative and
absolute measurements giving the robot feedback about its driving actions
and the situation of the environment around the robot. Given this informa-
tion, the robot has to determine its location as accurately as possible. What
makes this difficult is the existence of uncertainty in both the driving and
the sensing of the robot. The uncertain information needs to be combined
in an optimal way.
The Kalman Filter is a technique from estimation theory that combines
the information of different uncertain sources to obtain the values of vari-
ables of interest together with the uncertainty in these. The filter has been
successfully applied in many applications, like missions to Mars, and auto-
mated missile guidance systems. Although the concept of the filter is rel-
atively easy to comprehend, the advantages and shortcomings can only be
understood well with knowledge of the pure basics and with experience.
In this work we provide a thorough discussion of the robot localization
problem and Kalman Filter techniques. First, we look at current methods to
obtain location information, pointing out advantages and disadvantages. We
formalize how to combine this information in a probabilistic framework and
discuss several currently used methods that implement it. Second, we look at
the basic concepts involved in Kalman Filters and derive the equations of the
basic filter and commonly used extensions. We create understanding of the
workings, while discussing the differences between the extensions. Third, we
discuss and experimentally show how Kalman Filters can be applied to the
localization problem. We look at system and measurement models that are
needed by the filter; that is, we model a driving system, a GPS-like sensor,
and a landmark-based sensor. We perform simulations using these models in
our own general Kalman Filter simulator showing different behaviors when
applying the Kalman Filter to the localization problem. In order to use
the landmark-based sensor when it can not uniquely identify landmarks, we
extend the Kalman Filter to allow for multiple beliefs.
The material presented in this work forms a basis for further studies
in localization literature, application of Kalman Filters in any domain, and
in particular practical application of Kalman Filters and localization on
physical robots.},

of the main problems that is preventing the use of ROS in these applications is the question of characterizing its
security. In the summer of 2012, a crowd‐sourced cyber‐physical security contest was launched at the cyber‐
security conference DEFCON‐20 to begin the process of characterizing ROS. A small‐scale, car‐like robot was
configured as a cyber‐physical security research honeypot running ROS. DEFFCON‐20 attendees were invited to find
exploits and vulnerabilities in the robot while data on network traffic was collected. The results of this experiment
provided some interesting insights and opened up many security questions pertaining to deployed robotic systems.
The Federal Aviation Administration is tasked with opening up the civil airspace to commercial drones by September
2015 and driverless cars are already legal for research purposes in a number of states. Given the integration of
these robotic devices into our daily lives, the authors pose the following question: “What security exploits can a
motivated person with little‐to‐no experience in cyber security execute, given the wide availability of free cyber
security penetration testing tools such as Metasploit. This research focuses on applying common, low‐cost, low‐
overhead, cyber‐attacks on a robot featuring ROS. This work documents the effectiveness of those attacks},

  title       = {Mobile Robot Localization Based on Kalman Filter},
  institution = {Portland State University},
  year        = {2013},
  abstract    = {Robot localization is one of the most important subjects in the Robotics science. It
is an interesting and complicated topic. There are many algorithms to solve the problem of
localization. Each localization system has its own set of features, and based on them, a
solution will be chosen. In my thesis, I want to present a solution to find the best estimate
for a robot position in certain space for which a map is available. The thesis started with
an elementary introduction to the probability and the Gaussian theories. Simple and
advanced practical examples are presented to illustrate each concept related to localization.
Extended Kalman Filter is chosen to be the main algorithm to find the best estimate of the
robot position. It was presented through two chapters with many examples. All these
examples were simulated in Matlab in this thesis in order to give the readers and future
students a clear and complete introduction to Kalman Filter.
Fortunately, I applied this algorithm on a robot that I have built its base from
scratch. MCECS-Bot was a project started in Winter 2012 and it was assigned to me from
my adviser, Dr. Marek Perkowski. This robot consists of the base with four Mecanum
wheels, the waist based on four linear actuators, an arm, neck and head. The base is
equipped with many sensors, which are bumper switches, encoders, sonars, LRF and
Kinect. Additional devices can provide extra information as backup sensors, which are a
tablet and a camera. The ultimate goal of this thesis is to have the MCECS-Bot as an open
source system accessed by many future classes, capstone projects and graduate thesis
students for education purposes.
iA well-known MRPT software system was used to present the results of the
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). These results are simply the robot positions estimated by
EKF. They are demonstrated on the base floor of the FAB building of PSU. In parallel,
simulated results to all different solutions derived in this thesis are presented using Matlab.
A future students will have a ready platform and a good start to continue developing this
system.},

  abstract  = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic
RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work
well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However,
little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by
such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is
to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution re-
turned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number
of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under
mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based
algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper
is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM ∗ and RRT ∗ , which are provably asymptot-
ically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the
optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is
within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically op-
timal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic
sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},
